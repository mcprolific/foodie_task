Project 1
Foodie â€“ Restaurant Website Design

Scenario  
A restaurant brand called Foodie has a new static design image for their website.  
They want a team of developers to turn this design into a working website using only HTML + CSS.  

Because the file is only an image (not interactive), your team must use creativity and estimation to replicate the design as closely as possible.  

Goals of the Project:
1. Reproduce the layout and style of the Foodie design image.  
2. Practice design-to-code approximation when no detailed specs are given.  
3. Improve teamwork by dividing the project into structured parts.  
4. Develop attention to detail in fonts, colors, and alignment.  

Tasks for Students  
- Open the design image here ðŸ‘‰ [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/design/gy3gjJwI0IZwQB6SZqrWTN/Foodie?node-id=0-1&t=7HgXSe0GPHWqrbDV-1)  
- Study the sections (header, hero, food/menu, about, footer, etc.).  
- Approximate the spacing, font sizes, and colors to match the design.  
- Build a static HTML + CSS site with the appropriate sessions. All the sessions should be clickable
- With your creativity add appropriate footer to the design

 Design & Styling Rules  
- Use HTML for structure and CSS for styling.  
- Try to match the designâ€™s colors, fonts, and layout as closely as possible.  
- Approximate the paddings and spacing (doesnâ€™t have to be exact).  
- Use separate CSS file (`style.css`).  
- Keep your code neat with indentation and comments.
